Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenges

The Internet is an indispensable part of our daily economic and social life. Yet,  today  less than half of the world has Internet access. This means more than 3.5 billion remain offline.
 
Solutions to address lack of connectivity in rural areas, especially in developing countries, are limited. Mobile and broadband infrastructure is costly and takes time to build.
 
Internet giants spend billions of dollars on low orbit satellites, balloons and drone technologies for low cost coverage to bring internet to the next billion. 

What if we told you that every corner of the earth  where a moving vehicle can travel, so can Internet.
